A number of the results in this package are dependent on the choice of rate constants. We can distinguish between a chemical reaction network and a kinetic system, which is a chemical reaction network along with an assignment of parameters.  Functions that require one to supply a set of parameters will take p, a dictionary, vector, or tuple of symbol-value pairs as an argument.

When we say that a network is multistationary, or has the capacity for multiple steady states, what that means is that there is some stoichiometric compatibility class for which this is true. This means that there may be only one or zero steady states in some other stoichiometric compatibility class. The SCC can be inferred from  the initial concentrations of the species in a reaction network. Functions that optionally allow one to specify an initial set of concentrations will take u0, a dictionary, vector, or tuple of symbol-value pairs as an argument.
