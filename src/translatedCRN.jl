### This file contains methods corresponding to the methods of translated CRNs and 
# steady-state parametrizations, which can expand the range of networks for which
# it is possible to determine multistationarity and ACR for. 

# Generalized Mass Action systems with kinetic deficiency zero and effective deficiency zero
# have monomial parameterizations.
