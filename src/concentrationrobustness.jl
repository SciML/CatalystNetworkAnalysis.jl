    isconcentrationrobust(rn::ReactionSystem)

    Requires the parameter values be Rational or Integer. Check whether a reaction network has any concentration-robust species. Return codes: 
    - :MASS_ACTION_ACR - this species is concentration-robust for the given set of rate constants 
    - :GLOBAL_ACR - this species is absolutely concentration-robust for every choice of rate constants
    - :INCONCLUSIVE - the algorithm currently cannot decide whether this network has ACR. One could try calling this function with rate constants provided. 
    - :NO_ACR - the reaction network does not have ACR. 
    - :INEXACTPARAMS - the algorithm cannot conclude concentration-robustness due to inexact parameters (floats that are too small)

    Follows the approach outlined in [Puente et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00078).
