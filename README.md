# CatalystNetworkAnalysis

[![Build Status](https://github.com/vyudu/CatalystNetworkAnalysis.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/vyudu/CatalystNetworkAnalysis.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

CatalystNetworkAnalysis provides checks for certain network properties for reaction networks defined in Catalyst.jl. Suite is a WIP. Eventual functionality will include: 
- Determining dynamical properties of reaction systems: the capacity to admit multiple equilibria or periodic solutions, persistence, stability analyses, etc.
- Ability to perform flux balance analysis in reaction networks
